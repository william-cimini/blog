<h1 id="skip-waiting-for-internet-domain-name-server-configuration-changes">Skip waiting for internet domain name server configuration changes</h1>
<p>by William Cimini</p>
<h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>
<p>I was recently testing different name server providers for my internet domain, but I did not have a lot of time to wait for DNS to propagate.</p>
<h2 id="potential-solution">Potential solution</h2>
<p>Google provides a <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/cache">Flush Cache</a> tool which will refresh Google’s Public DNS cache.</p>
<p>While the Flush Cache tool is not guaranteed to work for every scenario, I was able to utilize the tool multiple times in a row to skip waiting hours for the latest configured name servers of my internet domain to resolve. </p>
<p>Your computer or network service most likely has to have Google Public DNS configured as the name server, or make use of another DNS service which operates closely to Google’s.</p>
